Longest period at number 1
  see LongestConsecutiveRun.ipynb
  maybe use .shift()
    you can see whether week1.shift(7) == week2
Farthest drop from number 1
Longest running song(s) - weeks in a row
Songs that have left the top 100 then rejoined
Shortest running song(s)
average position on charts
song on the charts for the most weeks (total)

PLAN

7-7-2020:
 *answer simple question - song on the charts for the most weeks (total)
   *group by song
   *count instances
   *find song with most instances
  map out algorithms for all the questions
 *rewatch seminar
   *play with code
 *do three more replit problems
  
 7-8-2020:
 *work on longest running song(s) - weeks in a row
 *work on shortest running song(s)
  do three more replit problems
  
7-9-2020:
  given a song graph the song's position on the charts over the course of it's existence
  work on longest period at number 1
  work on farthest drop from number 1
  do three more replit problems
